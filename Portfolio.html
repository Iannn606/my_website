        <p>my first major project in coding was a video game i made using python. I used my strong knowledge of python and object oriented programming
        to create a "platformer" game where a little character jumps around the screen and blocks. my second major project is this portfolio that 
        you are reading. I created this portfolio using a html file and styled it using css and javascript.</p>
